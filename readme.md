## Installation

To make this project your own, please follow the below steps

1. Download the most current build on [the repository's homepage](https://github.com/EngineerYo/Bathroom-Timer) sidebar. You'll want the `zip` file.
2. Extract using your file unzipper of choice. Keep track of where you extract the file to.
3. In your browser of choice, Open (Ctr+O) the `/src/index.html` in the package you extracted.

## Use

Users should type in their first name and their last name, then press the `Sign Out/In` button. This will start a stopwatch that counts up. Upon reaching 5 minutes, the window turns yellow as an indicator of moderately long check-out time. Upon the timer reaching 10 minutes, the windows will turn red to indicate a long check-out time. Signing out restores the window color.

For the administrator, every log out and in is logged into the browser's local cache. You can export this list by opening the administrator menu. You can open or close the administrator menu by pressing the following keys at the same time: `ctr + alt + shift + F12`. You may also clear the localstorage contents in this menu.
